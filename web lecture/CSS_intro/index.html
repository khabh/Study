        Cuttlefish have eight arms and two additional elongated
        tentacles that are used to grasp prey.
        The <a href="df">elongated</a> tentacles and mantle cavity serve as defense mechanisms;
        when approached by a predator, the cuttlefish can suck water into its
        mantle cavity and spread its arms in order to appear larger than normal.
        Though the <span>mantle cavity</span> is used for jet propulsion,
        the main parts of the body that are used for basic mobility are the fins,
        which can maneuver the cuttlefish in all directions.

    <h2>lifespan of cuttlefish <span class="chapter">chapter3</span></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The lifespan of cuttlefish is typically around one to two years, depending on the species.
        They hatch from eggs fully developed, around 6 mm (1⁄4 in) long, reaching 25 mm (1 in) around the first two
        months.
        Before death, cuttlefish go through <span>senescence</span> when the cephalopod essentially deteriorates, or
        rots in place.
        Their eyesight begins to fail, which affects their ability to see, move, and hunt efficiently.
        Once this process begins, cuttlefish tend to not live long due to predation by other organisms.
