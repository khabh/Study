# Bathâ€™s annual Christmas market runs from the 23rd of November 2017 until the 10th of December 2017.
# During this time, the market will occupy the entire square courtyard of Bath Abbey.

# To brighten things up at night, a single long strand of cheerful festive lights will be run along all four equally long edges of the courtyard.

# You will be in charge of buying the electrical wiring to which the lights will be affixed.
# How much will you need to use to outline the whole Christmas market with festive lights?
